# Git Guide - Windows ProcessâœŒ

## 0 Checking for Git

To see if you already have Git installed, open up your windows command prompt or "Git Bash".

Once you've opened your terminal application, type `git version`. The output will either tell you which version of Git is installed, like: 

![image-20241201114234585](https://yubaibaio-1312967958.cos.ap-chongqing.myqcloud.com/images/20241201114313.png)

or it will alert you that `git` is an unknown command. If it's an unknown command, read further and find out how to install Git.

## 1 Git Installation

### 1.1 Git Download

**Git can be downloaded from several sources:**

- [Official Git site](https://git-scm.com/) â€” There are the installers and source code for all systems and platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) â€” Directly for Windows systems.
- [Aliyun Mirror](https://registry.npmmirror.com/binary.html?path=git-for-windows/) â€” A mirror for faster downloads in some regions.

There takes Aliyun Mirror as an example, downloading ` Git-2.43.0-64-bit.exe`. You can use the shortcut Ctrl+F to find the version you need.

![image-20241129125919086](assets/image-20241129125919086.png)

#### Skip the detailed installation steps

**For a faster installation, you can just select the default installation option later in the installation process.** Skip directly to the introduction after the installation is complete. [Skip directly to the introduction ðŸ‘‹ [1.2.15 Installed successfully]](# 1.2.15 Installed successfully)

**If you want a more elaborate installation, then let's move on!**

#### 1.2.3 Select Components

- Select optional components for integration with Windows Explorer and context menus (Git Bash, Git GUI, etc.), which is very useful for ease of access.

![image-20241129130324207](assets/image-20241129130324207.png)

* [ ] **On the Desktop**:
  - This option creates a Git shortcut on your desktop for quick access to the Git Bash terminal.

* [x] **Windows Explorer Integration**:
  - This option integrates Git with the Windows File Explorer, enabling you to right-click on files or folders to access Git operations directly from the context menu.

- [x] **Open Git Bash here**:
  - This option adds an option to the Windows right-click context menu to open Git Bash directly in the folder you're currently in. It makes it easy to open a terminal window at a specific location.

* [x] **Open Git GUI here**:
  - Similar to "Open Git Bash here", this option adds an option to open the Git GUI from the right-click context menu. Git GUI is a graphical interface for Git, useful for users who prefer not to use the command line.

* [x] **Git LFS (Large File Support)**:
  - Git LFS is an extension to Git that helps manage large files, such as media assets (images, videos) or large datasets. It replaces large files with text pointers inside Git, while storing the actual file content on a separate server.

* [x] **Associate .git\* configuration files with the default text editor**:
  - This option ensures that any `.gitconfig` or `.gitignore` files (or other Git-related configuration files) are opened automatically with your default text editor when you double-click on them.

* [x] **Associate .sh files to be run with Bash**:
  - This option associates `.sh` shell script files with the Git Bash terminal. When you double-click on `.sh` files, they will open in Git Bash instead of the default Windows shell.

* [ ] **Check daily for Git for Windows updates**:
  - This option enables Git for Windows to check for updates daily. This ensures you're notified when a new version of Git is available for installation.

* [ ] **(NEW!) Add a Git Bash Profile to Windows Terminal**:
  - With this option, you can add Git Bash as a profile in Windows Terminal, which is a modern terminal emulator that supports multiple shell types (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash). This makes it easier to switch between different shells from a single terminal window.

* [x] **(NEW!) Scalar (Git add-on to manage large-scale repositories)**:
  - Scalar is a Git extension designed to help manage very large repositories. It improves performance when working with large-scale projects by optimizing certain aspects of Git's behavior (like fetching and cloning), making it easier to handle huge repositories with many files and branches.

#### 1.2.4 Set Up Start Menu Folder

- You can specify a folder in the Start Menu or opt to skip creating one.
- Click **Next**.

![image-20241129130400240](assets/image-20241129130400240.png)

After the installation is successful, the picture in the start menu is as follows:

![image-20241129133111844](assets/image-20241129133111844.png)

#### 1.2.5 Choosing Default Editor

- Git installs with Vim by default, but if you're not comfortable with Vim, selecting another editor like Notepad++ or VSCode might be easier.
- **Note**: If you choose Notepad++, install it first from [Notepad++ website](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).

![image-20241129130534041](assets/image-20241129130534041.png)

![image-20241129130609210](assets/image-20241129130609210.png)

![image-20241129130821606](assets/image-20241129130821606.png)

![image-20241129131009208](assets/image-20241129131009208.png)

After installation, you should also configure it in'My Computer - > Properties - > Advanced System Settings - > Advanced - > environment variables - > System Variables - > Path- > Edit and add the installation address of'Notepad ++ ', such as ` D:\Software\Notepad + `.

![image-20241129131210769](assets/image-20241129131210769.png)

#### 1.2.6 Select Default Branch Name

- Git will let you choose between `master` or `main` as the default branch name for new repositories.
- Most modern projects use `main` as the default branch.

![image-20241129131234889](assets/image-20241129131234889.png)

#### 1.2.7 Adjust PATH Environment Variable

- Choosing the second option is usually the best, as it allows Git to be used from any command-line interface (Git Bash, Command Prompt, PowerShell).

![image-20241129131247323](assets/image-20241129131247323.png)

#### 1.2.8 Select SSH or HTTPS

- Choose SSH if you're using SSH keys for remote connections, otherwise, HTTPS is fine for most users.

![image-20241129131306197](assets/image-20241129131306197.png)

![image-20241129131315042](assets/image-20241129131315042.png)

> If you use Git in an organization with enterprise-managed certificates, you will need to use secure channels. If you only use Git to access public repositories (such as GitHub), or if your organization doesn't manage its own certificates, then an SSL backend (which are just different implementations of the same protocol) is fine.

#### 1.2.9 Configure End-of-Line Conversion

- Itâ€™s recommended to choose **Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings** to prevent line-ending issues between Windows and Linux/Mac.

![image-20241129131333326](assets/image-20241129131333326.png)

#### 1.2.10 Configure Terminal Emulator

- The **MinTTY** option is recommended, as it provides a better user experience with Git Bash (e.g., adjustable window, better support for UTF-8).

![image-20241129131347645](assets/image-20241129131347645.png)

#### 1.2.11 Choose Default `git pull` Behavior

- The default option is **Merge**, which is suitable for most users. However, if you prefer rebasing, you can choose that option.

![image-20241129131358402](assets/image-20241129131358402.png)

#### 1.2.12 Credential Helper

- Enabling the Git credential manager will store your credentials securely so you don't need to re-enter them every time you interact with remote repositories.

![image-20241129131407260](assets/image-20241129131407260.png)

#### 1.2.13 Configuring extra options

- **Enable File System Caching:** This option enables Git to cache file system data in memory for faster access during operations that require reading a large number of files. It can significantly improve performance, particularly when working with large repositories. This option is enabled by default.

![image-20241129131451203](assets/image-20241129131451203.png)

#### 1.2.14 Finalize Installation

- This is an experimental function, and there may be some small errors and the like. It is recommended not to turn it on.

- Click **Install** to complete the installation process. After installation, Git Bash will be available in your Start Menu.

![image-20241129131508440](assets/image-20241129131508440.png)

#### 1.2.15 Installed successfully

![image-20241129131547798](assets/image-20241129131547798.png)

Then you can type `git version` on the windows command prompt or "Git Bash" to verify Git was installed.

## 2 Git Features Introduction

### 2.1 Introduction

- **Git Bash**

**Description**: Git Bash is a command-line tool that provides an environment similar to the Linux shell, allowing users to use Unix-like commands on the Windows system.
**Use**: With Git Bash, users can utilize Git's command-line functionality to perform version control tasks such as cloning repositories, committing changes, and more.

![image-20241129131644443](assets/image-20241129131644443.png)

- **Git CMD**

**Description**: Git CMD is a command-line tool that runs in the Windows command prompt. Unlike Git Bash, Git CMD is closer to the native Windows command-line environment.
**Use**: Similar to Git Bash, Git CMD allows users to execute Git commands in the command-line interface for version control operations.

![image-20241129131706354](assets/image-20241129131706354.png)

### 2.2 Basic Usage

#### 2.2.1 Terminology

- **Repository**:
   A Git repository is a storage space for a project that contains project files and version history. It can be a local repository or a remote repository.
- **Working Directory**:
   The working directory is the project folder you see on your computer, which contains project files and subdirectories.
- **Staging Area**:
   The staging area is an intermediate area where changes to be committed are stored. Before committing, you need to add changes to the staging area.
- **Commit**:
   A commit is an operation that saves changes from the working directory and staging area. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash value) and includes a description of the changes.
- **Branch**:
   A branch is a working line of development in a project. New branches can be created to develop new features or fix bugs, and then merged back into the main branch.
- **Main Branch**:
   The main branch is the default branch of a project, usually referred to as "master" or "main", and is the primary line of development for the project.
- **Remote Repository**:
   A remote repository is a copy of the project hosted on a network, such as on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, enabling collaboration among multiple developers.
- **Clone**:
   Cloning is the operation of copying the entire project from a remote repository to your local machine, creating a local copy of the repository.
- **Pull**:
   Pulling is the operation of fetching the latest changes from a remote repository and updating your local repository with those changes.
- **Push**:
   Pushing is the operation of uploading local changes to a remote repository, so the remote repository also contains the latest work.
- **Merge**:
   Merging is the operation of combining changes from different branches. It is usually used to merge new features or bug fixes back into the main branch.
- **Conflict**:
   A conflict occurs when changes from different branches conflict with each other during a merge, and manual resolution is required to resolve the conflicting changes.
